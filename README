How does iN-bash work?

The structure of iN-bash is based on simplicity and ease of adaptation. With just three files, any administrator can quickly start using it and adjust it as needed.

Main files:

target: Lists the IPs of the servers where commands will be executed remotely.
user: Specifies the user that will be used for SSH connections.
2dos: A file where you list the commands that will be executed sequentially on each server.

================================================================================================================

target: It should contain the list of IP addresses of the servers where the configurations will be executed.

Example:
192.0.2.1
198.51.100.2
203.0.113.3

================================================================================================================

user: Specifies the name of the user that will be used for the SSH connection

Example:
root

================================================================================================================

2dos: It should contain the list of commands you need to execute on the servers.

Example:
date
nproc
free -m

================================================================================================================

Running iN-bash
Execution with a list of commands: To run a list of commands defined in the 2dos file, simply execute:
chmod +x run
./run

Execution of a single command: If there is a need to run a specific command, just pass it as an argument to the run script, without the need to modify internal files:
./run "whoami"
